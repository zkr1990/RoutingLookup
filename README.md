# Routing Lookup project

This project deals with Routing Table Lookup using Perfect Hash oriented solutions.

All folders are used to provide source code and experiment results. Each folder is used as an independant experiment.

1. PHF_benchmark

Benchmark code for existing PHF algorithms: BDZ_PH, CHD_PH, BBHash, SPHF, SPHF-RL(algorithm for routing lookup task).

2. RHF

Routing Hash Function(RHF) source code: RHF1, RHF2 and RHF1-a.

3. RHF_64

Routing Hash Function(RHF) source code: RHF1_64.

4. RHF_10000

Routing Hash Function(RHF) source code: RHF1_64.

---------------------------------
The source code for hardware modules below is not available at this time.

5. HLS
Vivado HLS on Xilinx FPGA.

6. Vivado
RTL implementations on Xilinx FPGA.
